# Hypothyroidism-Machine-Learning-Model

"Predicts hypothyroidism using machine learning algorithms." This repository contains the code and resources for an AI/ML model designed to predict hypothyroidism.

Introduction
Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, is a common endocrine disorder. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing complications. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict hypothyroidism based on patient data, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses. Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle . It contains Dataset Name [e.g., age, sex, TSH, T3, T4 etc]

Description: This dataset is designed for the classification of hypothyroidism, a condition caused by an underactive thyroid gland. It contains a collection of patient data, including demographic information and the results of various thyroid function tests. The primary goal is to predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism based on these features. This dataset can be used to develop and evaluate machine learning models for early and accurate diagnosis of hypothyroidism, potentially improving patient outcomes.
*Features: The dataset includes the following features: Age: Numerical value representing the patient's age in years. Age is a known factor that can influence thyroid function, with certain age groups potentially having a higher risk of hypothyroidism.

Sex: Categorical variable indicating the patient's sex (e.g., Male, Female). Sex is a significant factor in thyroid disorders, with women generally being more susceptible to hypothyroidism.

TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone): Numerical value representing the concentration of TSH in the blood (e.g., mIU/L). TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. Elevated TSH levels often indicate hypothyroidism.

T3 (Triiodothyronine): Numerical value representing the concentration of T3 in the blood (e.g., ng/dL or pmol/L). T3 is one of the primary thyroid hormones. Low T3 levels can suggest hypothyroidism.

TT4 (Total Thyroxine): Numerical value representing the concentration of TT4 in the blood (e.g., Î¼g/dL or nmol/L). TT4 is the main hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Low TT4 levels are a key indicator of hypothyroidism.

T3 measured: Binary or categorical variable indicating if the T3 value was measured. (e.g. true/false or yes/no) This is included because in some medical records, tests are not always conducted, and the presence or absence of a test can be a significant piece of information.

Target Variable: Hypothyroid [Binary Class]: Binary categorical variable indicating the presence or absence of hypothyroidism (e.g., True/False, 1/0, Positive/Negative). This is the variable that the machine learning models will aim to predict.
